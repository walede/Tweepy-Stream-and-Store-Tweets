# Tweepy-Stream-and-Store-Tweets
This project streams tweets and has the functionality to store in a MySQL, Elasticsearch, and Mongo DB database.

##Introduction:
This project has the functionality to connect to MySQL, Elasticsearch, and the Mongo DB database.
Any of the features can be commented out or extended as required.

Will be adding sample queries and maybe extensions to other databases going forward.
